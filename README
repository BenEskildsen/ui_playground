compile with
 > ./compile.bash
files in js get babelified into bin and then browser-side-required into bundle.js

run with
 > python -m SimpleHTTPServer
and then go to localhost:8000 in the browser

clone with
 > cp -rf UI/ NEWDIR
 > sudo rm -rf node_modules
 > ./template.bash
installs this project's node dependencies
make sure you have a
  .babelrc
to get actual babel support *sigh*
and also make sure to have copied over the scripts field of package.json
